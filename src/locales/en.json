We know how many difficulties patients with rare diseases face, how many questions they have day by day and how many things they need to google to find the ways to adapt their life for living with the diagnosis. But we also know that Dr Google is not always a trustworthy source of information!\nThis is why we have organized Rarus Health Academy - a section of our digital platform, where we conduct educational events that are requested by the patients. We are proud to share only curated information, which is based on international clinical guidelines and prepared together with scientists and medical professionals! \nWe will discuss the following topics:\n\tGenetic tests to get the right diagnostics\n\tRed flags of “bad symptoms”: when you have to run to your doctor\n\tAnnual check ups for kids and adults with NF\n\tPlexiform neurofibromas: the latest progress in the treatment\n\tScientific progress in NF: on-going clinical trials \nWho is the webinar for?\n\tThe webinar is aimed at patients with NF1 and their caregivers. It will be especially useful for newly diagnosed patients or the ones that would like to know more about their diagnosis and last achievements in the treatment.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\tElmira Safarova, PhD in Molecular Biology and Pharmacology, CEO of Rarus Health SpA, 20+ years of experience in the Life Science industry, expert in R&D of new drugs.
